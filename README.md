# FLUXNET and Land Model Comparison Analysis

This repository includes all files used in the analysis of the FLUXNET observations to NASA GMAO land models.
FLUXNET observations are constrainted to the AmeriFlux FLUXNET networks located in North, Central and South America. Data is available for download at: https://ameriflux.lbl.gov/login/?redirect_to=/data/download-data/. Users must create an account to access.

Jupyter-notebooks/ serves as a Sandbox for testing.

site-plots/ includes scripts for preprocessing land model data and generating comparison plots of each FLUXNET tower site selected to the land model.

statistics/ includes a statistical analysis ongoing to generate insights on which sites see major deviation between model and flux tower observation.
