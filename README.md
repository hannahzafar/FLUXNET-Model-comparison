# FLUXNET and Land Model Comparison Analysis

This repository includes all files used in the analysis of the FLUXNET observations to NASA GMAO land models.

Jupyter-notebooks/ serves as a Sandbox for testing.

site-plots/ includes scripts for preprocessing land model data and generating comparison plots of each FLUXNET tower site selected to the land model.

statistics/ includes a statistical analysis ongoing to generate insights on which sites see major deviation between model and flux tower observation.
